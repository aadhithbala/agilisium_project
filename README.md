Hereâ€™s a sample README file for your basic To-Do app that contains CRUD functionality, utilizing Docker for containerization. You can adjust the content as needed to fit your project specifics.

# To-Do App

This is a basic To-Do application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The application is containerized using Docker and consists of two Docker containers: one for the Node.js application and another for the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Docker Compose installed on your machine.


## Configuration

Before you start the application, you may want to customize the database configuration and the Docker settings.

1. **Modify Database Configuration:**
   Open the `db.config.js` file and update the following fields as necessary:
   - `PASSWORD`: Set your desired MySQL root password.
   - `DB`: Set the name of the database you want to create or use.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     HOST: "mysql_db",
     USER: "root",
     PASSWORD: "your_new_password",
     DB: "your_database_name",
     dialect: "mysql",
     pool: {
       max: 5,
       min: 0,
       acquire: 30000,
       idle: 10000
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Modify Docker Compose Configuration:**
   Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and update the following environment variables for the MySQL service as necessary:
   - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Set the MySQL root password.
   - `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Set the name of the database you want to create.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_new_password
     - MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database_name
   ```

## Building the Docker Image

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` for the Node.js application. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t todo_app .
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start both the Node.js application and the MySQL database containers in detached mode.

## Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove the containers, run the following command in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Conclusion

You now have a basic To-Do app running with CRUD functionality using Docker containers. Feel free to modify the application further to suit your needs!
